AUM: A Unified Modelling scheme for galaxy abundance, galaxy clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing.


This piece of software has general purpose routines that allow prediction of
the galaxy abundances, their clustering and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, given the halo occupation distribution of galaxies and the underlying cosmological model. 

In combination with the measurements of the clustering, abundance and lensing
of galaxies, these routines can be used to perform parameter inferences.
